      Isaac Newton's religious beliefs were unorthodox and largely kept private, as they deviated from mainstream Christianity. He studied theology extensively, with over half of his writings dedicated to religious and alchemical subjects. Newton rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, siding with Arius in the historical debate over Christ's nature. He saw Christ as a divine mediator but subordinate to God the Father. His views, considered heretical, led him to avoid ordination, and he secured a special exemption from the requirement. Worshipping Jesus as God, in Newton's eyes, was idolatry, a fundamental sin. Scholars now categorize him as an anti-Trinitarian, with sympathies towards Socinianism and Arianism.

      Despite his scientific discoveries, Newton strongly believed in divine intervention and rejected a purely mechanistic universe. He argued that gravity could explain planetary motion but that God's power was necessary to sustain it. This belief led to a famous debate with Leibniz, who mocked Newton's idea that God needed to occasionally "wind up" the universe. Later, Pierre-Simon Laplace provided a purely scientific explanation for planetary stability, challenging Newton's position. Nonetheless, Newton saw the universe's order as evidence of intelligent design, emphasizing that science and faith were not mutually exclusive.

      Newton's rational approach to science influenced religious thought during the Enlightenment. He and Robert Boyle promoted mechanical philosophy, which was embraced by both orthodox and dissident preachers as a counter to superstition and atheism. His discoveries were used to support the idea of "Natural Religion," demonstrating a universe governed by divine laws. Newton's mathematical proofs reinforced Boyle's ideas, helping to shift religious thought towards a more reasoned, scientific perspective while maintaining belief in divine design.
