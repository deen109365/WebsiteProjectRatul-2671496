      <i>Isaac Newton was born (according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian Calander</a> in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, <mark style="color:brown;">25 December 1642</mark>
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates">NS</a> 4 January 1643) in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, three months after the death of his father. Born prematurely, he was a frail child, and his mother, Hannah Ayscough, later remarried the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving Newton in the care of his maternal grandmother. He resented his stepfather and harbored some hostility towards his mother for the marriage. Newton had three half-siblings—Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah-from his mother's second marriage. His early life was marked by a sense of isolation and emotional struggle, which later influenced his intense focus on studies and discoveries.

        From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King%27s_School,_Grantham">
        The King's School</a> in Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659.
        His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated. Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.

          In June 1661, Newton was admitted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge"> Trinity College</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"> University of Cambridge</a>
          upon the recommendation of his uncle, Reverend William Ayscough. He began as a subsizar, performing menial duties to support his education, but secured a scholarship in 1664, covering his costs until he completed his MA. At Cambridge, Newton studied Aristotle's works and modern philosophers like René Descartes and Galileo. In 1665, he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and started developing calculus. Shortly after obtaining his BA, Cambridge closed due to the Great Plague, forcing Newton to return home to Woolsthorpe.

            During the next two years, Newton made groundbreaking discoveries in calculus, optics, and gravity, which later shaped modern physics. Although he was not distinguished as a student, his independent research during this period was described as one of the most productive ever. Newton was highly meticulous in note-taking and had a wide range of intellectual interests. His ability to combine seemingly unrelated fields enabled him to make creative breakthroughs in science and mathematics.

            Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a fellow of Trinity College. Although fellows were typically required to take holy orders, Newton’s unorthodox religious views made this a challenge. By 1669, he became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, succeeding Isaac Barrow, and argued successfully for an exemption from ordination. King Charles II granted this request, allowing Newton to continue his academic pursuits without conflict with Anglican orthodoxy.

            As Lucasian Professor, Newton had responsibilities that included instructing geography. He revised and republished Bernhardus Varenius' Geographia Generalis in 1672 and 1681, helping to modernize the field. Although it is unclear whether he lectured on geography, his editions of the book contributed significantly to the discipline.

          Newton's contributions extended beyond mathematics and physics into the realm of optics. He conducted experiments with light and prisms, leading to his theory that white light is composed of different colors. This work later became the foundation of his book Opticks, which revolutionized the understanding of light and vision. His findings sparked debates with other scientists, notably Robert Hooke, but cemented Newton's reputation as a leading thinker of his time

            Beyond academia, Newton played a significant role in public service. In 1696, he was appointed Warden of the Royal Mint, where he led efforts to reform England’s currency system and combat counterfeiting. Later, he became the President of the Royal Society, further solidifying his influence in the scientific world. His monumental work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, laid the foundation for classical mechanics and introduced the laws of motion and universal gravitation, making him one of the most influential scientists in history.
