            Isaac Newton often recounted that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation after observing an apple fall from a tree. This story gained widespread recognition after being shared by his niece, Catherine Barton, and later popularized by Voltaire in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727). Although some consider it a myth, firsthand accounts from Newton's acquaintances, such as William Stukeley and John Conduitt, confirm that Newton indeed reflected on the nature of gravity while observing a falling apple, though it never actually struck his head. Stukeley recorded a conversation with Newton in which he pondered why apples always fell straight to the ground and reasoned that a force from the Earth must be pulling them down.

       <p>
            Newton's assistant, John Conduitt, described how Newton's contemplation of the falling apple in 1666 led him to question whether gravity extended beyond Earth, perhaps even reaching the Moon. Newton's notebooks from the late 1660s reveal that he was already exploring the idea that gravity follows an inverse-square law and might be responsible for the Moon's orbit. However, it took him nearly two decades to fully develop his theory of universal gravitation. He demonstrated that if gravity weakened with distance in an inverse-square manner, it could accurately explain the Moon’s orbit and other celestial motions. This breakthrough led Newton to formulate his law of universal gravitation, which became a fundamental principle in physics.

            Several locations claim to have the famous apple tree from Newton's story. The King's School, Grantham, asserts that they transported the tree to their headmaster’s garden, while Woolsthorpe Manor, Newton’s birthplace, insists that their tree is the original. A descendant of this tree can be seen at Trinity College, Cambridge, outside Newton’s former residence. Additionally, the National Fruit Collection in Brogdale preserves a tree identical to the Flower of Kent variety, which is believed to be the same type as the one from Newton’s childhood home.

        Newton's monument (1731) in Westminster Abbey, sculpted by Michael Rysbrack and designed by William Kent, features a reclining Newton atop a sarcophagus, his elbow resting on his books and his hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him, a celestial globe displays the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the 1680 comet, while a relief panel below depicts putti using scientific instruments. Newton's image also appeared on Series D £1 banknotes (1978–1988) issued by the Bank of England, showing him with a book, a telescope, a prism, and a map of the Solar System.

        Several statues of Newton exist, including one at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, another in Grantham in front of the Guildhall (erected in 1858), and a large bronze statue, Newton, after William Blake by Eduardo Paolozzi (1995), in the piazza of the British Library. Woolsthorpe Manor, his birthplace and the site of his discoveries on gravity and light refraction, is a Grade I listed building.
