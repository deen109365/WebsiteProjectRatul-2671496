            Isaac Newton made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, particularly with his development of calculus, which he initially called "fluxions." By 1665, he had already formulated methods to compute tangents and curvatures of curves, and by 1666, he had mastered the essential techniques of calculus. His work remained unpublished for years due to concerns over criticism, leading to a later dispute with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the priority of its discovery. Although both are credited with independently developing calculus, Newton's work predated Leibniz’s by nearly a decade. However, Leibniz's notation was eventually favored in Europe due to its convenience. Despite this, Newton’s geometric approach and his method of "first and last ratios" were highly influential, with his Principia showcasing advanced calculus concepts that anticipated later developments in mathematical analysis.

            Beyond calculus, Newton significantly advanced various mathematical fields. He formulated the generalized binomial theorem, introduced Newton’s identities, and pioneered the classification of cubic plane curves. His contributions to finite differences, numerical integration (Newton-Cotes formulas), and power series expanded the foundations of modern mathematics. He also developed coordinate geometry techniques for solving Diophantine equations and was the first to use fractional indices confidently. Newton’s insights into the calculus of variations were groundbreaking, with his work on minimal resistance and the brachistochrone problem demonstrating the power of these methods. His influence extended to vector analysis, where he applied the parallelogram law for physical quantities and decomposed them into components, laying the groundwork for later developments in physics and engineering.

            Newton's mathematical achievements not only transformed the discipline but also had profound implications for physics and engineering. His calculus methods were instrumental in solving differential equations and formulating key principles in mechanics. His reluctance to publish his findings led to a prolonged dispute with Leibniz, which escalated through accusations of plagiarism and official investigations by the Royal Society. Despite these controversies, Newton’s impact remains unparalleled. His ability to blend rigorous mathematical reasoning with physical applications made his contributions fundamental to the advancement of science. From infinite series to vector analysis, Newton’s mathematical legacy continues to shape modern mathematical thought and its applications across various scientific domains.

            In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light - a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.
          </p>

          <p>
            From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.
         </p>

         <p>
            In his work on Newton's rings in 1671, he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century, as "he averaged all of the differences, and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring", in effect introducing a now standard method for reducing noise in measurements, and which does not appear elsewhere at the time.He extended his "error-slaying method" to studies of equinoxes in 1700, which was described as an "altogether unprecedented method" but differed in that here "Newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times, and so he devised a method that allowed them to, as it were, self-correct." Newton wrote down the first of the two 'normal equations' known from ordinary least squares and introduced "an embryonic linear regression analysis", as he averaged a set of data, 50 years before Tobias Mayer and also "summing the residuals to zero he forced the regression line to pass through the average point". He also "distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an optimal solution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness".
         </p>

         <p>
            He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. His 1672 paper on the nature of white light and colours forms the basis for all work that followed on colour and colour vision
        </p>

        <p>
          Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). Physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Despite his known preference of a particle theory, Newton in fact noted that light had both particle-like and wave-like properties in Opticks, and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories, thereby anticipating later developments of wave-particle duality, which is the modern understanding of light.

          Isaac Newton developed his theory of gravitation as early as 1665 and later revisited celestial mechanics in 1679, considering its impact on planetary orbits in relation to Kepler's laws. His interest was further stimulated by the appearance of a comet in 1680-1681. In 1684, Newton presented his findings on planetary motion in De motu corporum in gyrum, which formed the foundation of his later work, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687).

        <p>
          <i>
          The Principia, published with the support of Edmond Halley, introduced Newton's three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. This work laid the foundation for classical mechanics and influenced technological advancements during the Industrial Revolution. Newton used the term "gravitas" (weight) to describe gravity and achieved the first major unification in physics. He also solved the two-body problem and introduced the three-body problem.

          <i>
        In the Principia, Newton applied calculus-like methods to analyze motion, determined the speed of sound based on Boyle's law, explained Earth's shape and precession, studied lunar motion irregularities, and formulated a theory for cometary orbits. His work on the Moon's motion was so complex that it caused him health issues. Additionally, Newton estimated Earth’s age through experimental calculations.
        Newton supported the heliocentric model, emphasizing that the Solar System revolves around its center of gravity rather than the Sun alone. His ideas on gravity were initially criticized as introducing "occult forces," but in the second edition of the Principia (1713), he dismissed such criticisms, emphasizing that he did not speculate on the cause of gravity.
       Newton also made contributions to mathematics, categorizing cubic curves and advancing fluid dynamics. He formulated Newton's law of cooling (1701), which describes heat transfer, and introduced the concept of Newtonian fluids, defining viscosity in fluids. His extensive work earned him international recognition and a following of admirers.
